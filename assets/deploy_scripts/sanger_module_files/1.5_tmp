    puts stderr "YASCP (Yet Another Single Cell (scRNA) Pieline: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp) is a nextflow pipeline that QCs the scRNA Cellranger data by removing ambient RNA, deconvoluting donors, assigning celltypes, analysing concordances vs expected genotypes. IMPROVEMENTS: 1) Added support for cellranger 7 input files. 2) Improved filtering for the Citeseq data, 3) for JUST_RECLUSTER option we now allow not to to perform integration (and any variable regression) before subclustering to assess the clustering optimisations 4) For test dataset we drop gpu dependant cellbender so data can be tested."
