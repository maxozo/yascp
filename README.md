## Introduction

**nf-core/yascp** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline tailored for deconvolution, quality control, clustering, and integration of single-cell datasets. Developed under the leadership of N.Soranzo and Human Genetics Informatics (HGI), this large-scale single-cell pipeline was originally crafted for the Cardinal project (profiling UKBB and ELGH participants) but is versatile enough for broader scRNA analysis applications. The foundational ideas were inspired by earlier pipelines from Anderson lab but has been expanded, specifically those for [deconvolution](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_scrna_deconvolution.git), [cellbender](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_cellbender), and [quality control and clustering](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_qc_cluster/tree/main). This ensures a robust integration of proven methodologies tailored to meet the demands of expansive single-cell data analysis.

Input requires a tsv seperated file [(please read detailed documentation here)](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/tree/yascp_docs) with paths and if running in an genotype  additional input is required to be provided in an input.nf file pointing to the vcf location. This pipeline is designed to be used any large scale single cell experiments.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->
<!-- On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/yascp/results). -->

## Documentation: Prepearing your own data and interpreting the results

To understand how to prepeare your own data and how to interpret the results please refear to documents [HERE](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/tree/yascp_docs)

## Quick Start
Easyest to do is using a conda enviroment.

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.04.0`)
    ```console
    conda install nextflow=21.04.0
    ```

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download/clone the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    !NOTE: you need to define your institution specific queues in the conf/base.conf or provide aditional config file with -c flag in folowing comand such as: -c /path/to/yascp/conf/extra_confs/sanger/base.conf



    ```console
    nextflow run /path/to/colned/yascp -profile test_full,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    !ALSO: by default this test dataset will run cellbender with a cpus - only performing 10 epochs. Cellbender is built for a gpu queue, so for the actual runs the deafault is to utilise_gpu = true
    You need to make sure that the gpu queue according to your institution is defined in confs: withLabel: gpu {} as for sanger [`config file`](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/blob/0fce7bd8ce4ca734e34b28443fe89630e295b1eb/conf/extra_confs/sanger/base.conf#L180-L194)

    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` then the pipeline will auto-detect this and attempt to download the Singularity images directly as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images. If you are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues then please use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, it is highly recommended to use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to pre-download all of the required containers before running the pipeline and to set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.



## Credits

Yascp was originally written by Matiss Ozols as part of the Cardinal project but is applicable to many other projects with contributions from Leland Taylor, Guillaume Noell, Hannes Ponstingl, Vivek Iyer,  Henry Taylor, Tobi Alegbe, Monika Krzak, Alessandro Raveane, Carl Anderson, Anna Lorenc, Stephen Watt, Nicole Soranzo.
<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Contributions and Support

We wellcome all contributions. If you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please create a fork and then create a pull request, and inform Matiss (mo11@sanger.ac.uk) re the changes made and additions added.
